Today I learned more about PostgreSQL indexes.

**Theory**

*The theory says, as long as the leftmost column in the query already has a single index or that leftmost column is the leftmost column on some other composite index, then there is no need to have another composite index . The crux: other columns should not be having a lot of data corresponding to that left most column.*

**Index usage of the table**

{% highlight sql %}
  select * from pg_stat_all_indexes where relname = 'dummy_table';
{% endhighlight %}

The space taken by an index:

{% highlight sql %}
select pg_size_pretty(pg_table_size('idempotency_index'));
{% endhighlight %}

**Percentage of Index used**

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT
  relname,
  100 * idx_scan / (seq_scan + idx_scan) percent_of_times_index_used,
  n_live_tup rows_in_table
FROM
  pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE
    seq_scan + idx_scan > 0
ORDER BY
  n_live_tup DESC;
{% endhighlight %}

**Cache hit ratio**

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT
  sum(idx_blks_read) as idx_read,
  sum(idx_blks_hit)  as idx_hit,
  (sum(idx_blks_hit) - sum(idx_blks_read)) / sum(idx_blks_hit) as ratio
FROM
  pg_statio_user_indexes;
{% endhighlight %}

**Impact Caused By Unused Indexes:**

*It reduces the cache hit ratio since it will occupy some space in cache in the beginning. Itâ€™s highly probable that part of some other useful index lies in the disk rather than cache. So when a query comes, it goes and checks in disk, thereby reducing the cache hit ratio.*

*Percentage of indexes used will decrease.*
