Welcome back to [Satori](http://vumanhcuongit.github.io/ruby/2014/10/08/satori-1/)! Today, I'd like to talk about [map method](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Array.html#method-i-map). You may know this method and it's definition:

> Invokes the given block once for each element of self. Creates a new array containing the values returned by the block.

Last month, I got confused when seeing this case:

{% highlight ruby %}
arr = [1,2,3]
def my_confusion(arr)
  result = Array.new
  arr.map { |element| result << element * 2 }
end
#=> [[2, 4, 6], [2, 4, 6], [2, 4, 6]]
{% endhighlight %}

**Misconception:**

Based on the above definition, I thought ```my_confusion``` returns ```[[2], [2, 4], [2, 4, 6]]``` but it doesn't. So there is something wrong with *map method* ?

**Awakening:**

[Array#<<](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Array.html#method-i-3C-3C): this expression returns the **array itself**, so a result of this evaluation ```result << element * 2``` is a reference that points to one and only one array in memory. Therefore, *map method* returns the array containing **there references** pointing to only one array. After running three loops, this array contains ```[2, 4, 6]```.

Thanks Patrice and Stefan! You should see [their great answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26201908/how-does-rubys-map-method-work-in-this-case?answertab=votes#tab-top).

That's enough for my second Satori and thanks for your concern. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to discuss with me :).
