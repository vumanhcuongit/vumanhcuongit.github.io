In order to help users can using [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), I use cheat sheet to help them. In addition, it should be **small** and includes some important references, so I remove some redundant cases.

You can click [here](http://bit.ly/lite-markdown-cheatsheet) to download. By the way, I have [this demo](http://markdown-lite.herokuapp.com/) using this file.

I included CSS in this file too (because I'm lazy), hope you ignore this problem :)

p/s: I wrote a [new tip](https://coderwall.com/p/dnnlea?i=5&p=1&q=author%3Avumanhcuongit&t%5B%5D=vumanhcuongit) about truncate a string written by Markdown format.
References: I complied from a [cheat sheet](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html).
