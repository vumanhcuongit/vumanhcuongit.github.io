Today, I have an idea to open a category named *Satori*. In this category, I'd like to share my misconception about Ruby language as well as awakening after that. So this is the first *Satori*.

> The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Actually, you know that *Ruby returns the last evaluated expression*. Yesterday, I got a mistake about this and I want to show off it ~*yaoming*~.

{% highlight ruby %}
def my_mistake(number = 1)
  'First line' if number == 1
  'Second line' if number == 2
end
{% endhighlight %}

I thought this method would return "First line", but I got wrong. As it turns out, it returns ```nil```.

**Misconception:** I thought it doesn't execute code if the conditional is false.

**Awakening:** The last line returns ```nil```, so "First line" need to return immediately if the conditional is true. I solve it by this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def my_mistake(number = 1)
  return 'First line' if number == 1
  'Second line' if number == 2
end
{% endhighlight %}

**updated 2014-11-07**

I've got this case and maybe you'd like to know:

{% highlight ruby %}
def my_logger(number)
  number
  Rails.logger.info "Hey! I make your function work wrong."
end

my_logger(2)
#=> true
{% endhighlight %}



That's enough for my first *Satori* and thanks for your concern. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to discuss with me :).
