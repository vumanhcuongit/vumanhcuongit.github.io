I've written blog in [Coderwall](http://coderwall.com) but I think it's better if I own a blog :)

In addition, I'll transfer these [tips](https://coderwall.com/p/u/vumanhcuongit) from [Coderwall](http://coderwall.com) to here.

I'm using Jekyll and the free Github's hosting. Moreover, I don't know how to set up tags and categories for this blog now. Maybe I'll fix it in the future :).

By the way, Welcome to my blog !
