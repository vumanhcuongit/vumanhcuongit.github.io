My name is Vu Manh Cuong and I am currently a software developer at the Saigonium Labs, primarily using Ruby and Javascript. This blog is the place I share my knowledge as well as revise what I've learnt.

I wrote blog in [Coderwall](http://coderwall.com) but I think it's better if I own a blog *like-a-boss*. Therefore, I use Jekyll and the free Github's hosting to build this blog.

In addition, I transfered these [tips](https://coderwall.com/p/u/vumanhcuongit) from [Coderwall](http://coderwall.com) to here.

By the way, Welcome to [my blog](http://vumanhcuongit.github.io) !
